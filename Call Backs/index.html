	<h1 id="testing_callbacks">Javascript Callbacks</h1>
	<p>What you just experienced is a result of this code. It demonstrates hose methods are passed and invoked in Javascript.  Here we define an array of callback methods called 'songs' and proceed to play each one by name on load.</p>

	<pre>
		//Document Load Event Handler.
		//NOTE: JQuery events perform call backs to methods. Hence we pass the function in line.	
		$(function(){                          	
			alert('Jukebox Turned On');
			play(songs['headlikeahole'])
			play(songs['goodfellow'])
			play(songs['happybirthday'])
			alert('Jukebox Turned Off');
		})


		//Defining a map of key to callback methods.
		var songs = {
		    'headlikeahole': 
				function (){
					alert('Head like a hole!!!');
					alert('Performed by NIN.');
				},

			'goodfellow': 
				function (){
					alert('For He is a Jolly Good Fellow!');
		   			alert('Performed by Drunk People.');
				},


			'happybirthday': 
				function (){
					alert('Happy Birthday To You');
		   			alert('Performed by folks at a B-Day party!!!');

		//Code used to invoke a song;
		function play(song){

			song.call();
